# LowesAppTest

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.4.9.

## Developer's Note

I'd like to add that the only reason I'm using Typescript is because the angular-cli uses it and it's the best tool for the job. I prefer writting native Javascript because of the [law of leaky abstraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_abstraction). This also makes working with angular 10x easier.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. Also please install this addon else you won't be able to retrieve the json
