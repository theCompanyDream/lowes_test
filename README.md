# LowesAppTest

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.4.9.

## Developer's Note

I'd like to add that the only reason I'm using Typescript is because the angular-cli uses it and it's the best tool for the job. I prefer writing native Javascript because of the [law of leaky abstraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_abstraction). This also makes working with angular 10x easier.

## Development server
First install this addon for either [Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi), [Mozilla Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cors-everywhere/). Then
run `npm init`, then run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. 



## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
